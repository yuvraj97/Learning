Deep neural networks that are developed for computer vision have been proven to be an effective method to analyze layout of document images. However, document layout datasets that are currently publicly available are several magnitudes smaller than established computing vision datasets. Models have to be trained by transfer learning from a base model that is pre-trained on a traditional computer vision dataset. In this paper, we develop the PubLayNet dataset for document layout analysis by automatically matching the XML representations and the content of over 1 million PDF articles that are publicly available on PubMed Central™. The size of the dataset is comparable to established computer vision datasets, containing over 360 thousand document images, where typical document layout elements are annotated. The experiments demonstrate that deep neural networks trained on PubLayNet accurately recognize the layout of scientiﬁc articles. The pre-trained models are also a more effective base mode for transfer learning on a different document domain. We release the dataset to support development and evaluation of more advanced models for document layout analysis.

After all the text XML nodes are processed, the margin between annotated text elements in the PDF page is utilized to annotate the body of ﬁgures and tables. 2 illustrates an example of the annotation process for a ﬁgure body. First, the bounding box of the main text of the article (green box) is obtained as the smallest bounding box that encloses all the annotated text elements in the article. Then the potential box (blue box) for the ﬁgure is calculated as the the largest box that can be ﬁt in the margin between the top of the caption box (brown box) and the annotated text elements above the caption. The last step is to annotate the ﬁgure body with the smallest box (red box) that encloses all the textboxes, images, and geometric shapes within the potential box. Table bodies are annotated using the same principle, where it is assumed that table bodies are always below the caption of the tables.',\n",

       " 'The annotated PDF pages are partitioned into training, development, and testing sets at journal level to maximize the differences between the sets. This allows better evaluation of how well a model generalizes to unseen paper templates. The journals that contain ≤ 2000 pages, ≥ 320 ﬁgures, ≥ 140 tables, and ≥ 20 lists are extracted to generate the development and testing sets. This avoids the development and testing sets from being dominated by a particular journal with a large number of pages, and ensures the development and testing sets have an adequate number instances of ﬁgures, tables, and lists. Half of these journals are randomly drawn to generate the development set. The development set consists of all pages with a list in these journals, as well as 2000 title pages, 3000 pages with a table, 3000 pages with a ﬁgure, and 2000 plain pages, which are randomly drawn from these journals. The testing set is generated using the same procedure on the rest half of the journals. To further reduce the noise in the development and testing sets and make more valid evaluation of models, the development and testing sets are curated by human, where profound erroneous pages are removed and moderate erroneous pages are corrected. The journals that do not satisfy the criteria above are used to generate the training set. To ensure diversity of the training data, from each of the journals, we randomly drawn at most 200 pages with a list, 50 pages with a table, 50 pages with a ﬁgure, 50 title pages, and 25 plain pages. The statistics of the training, development, and testing sets are depicted in detail in Table II.',\n",

       " 'The ICDAR 2013 Table Competition [21] is one of the most prestigious competitions on table detection in PDF documents from European government sources. We created a table detection dataset by extracting from our training set the PDF pages that contain one or more tables, and remove non-table instances from the annotations. We trained a F-RCNN model and a M-RCNN model on this table detection dataset under the same conﬁguration described in Section IV-A. Then the models are ﬁne-tuned with the 170 example PDF pages provided by the competition. For ﬁne-tuning, we used a base learning rate 0.001, which was decreased by 10 at the 100th iteration out of 200 total iterations. The minimum conﬁdence score for a detection is decided by a 5-fold cross-validation on the 170 training pages. The ﬁne-tuned model was evaluated on the formal competition dataset (238 pages) using the ofﬁcial evaluation toolkit 9. Table IV compares the performance of the ﬁne-tuned models and published approaches. The ﬁne tuned F-RCNN model achieves the state-of-the-art performance reported in [6], where the F-RCNN model was ﬁne tuned with 1600 samples from a pre-trained object detection model. By ﬁne tuning from a model pre-trained on document samples, we can obtain the same level of performance with much smaller training data (170 samples).',\n",

There is a large variety in the layout of SPD documents provided by different companies. The layout of these documents is also distinctively different from scientiﬁc publications. We manually annotated the texts, tables, and lists in 20 representative SPD documents that cover a large number of possible layouts.

       " 'PMCOA provides a large set of documents available at the same time in PDF and XML format. The methodology proposed in this work to generate a large dataset of article pages automatically annotated with the location of document layout components using the PMCOA documents. The quality assurance has shown that the automatically generated annotations are of high quality. In addition, existing state-of-the-art object detection algorithms reproduce successfully the annotations from the automatically annotated set. The title category seems to be the weakest one. The identiﬁcation of titles is challenging due to the different ways in which titles are present in the documents. On the other hand, titles are identiﬁed as text in ICDAR competitions and titles could be merged with the text category in this set up. The documents in PubLayNet are all scientiﬁc literature, which is domain speciﬁc and limits the heterogeneity of layout. We took several methods in developing and partition PubLayNet to utilize as much variation in PMCOA as possible and prevent PubLayNet from being dominated by a certain journal. With over 6,500 journals included in PMCOA, our experiment shows that the training set is heterogeneous enough',\n",

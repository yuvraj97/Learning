      "Abstract—Recognizing the layout of unstructured digital documents is an important step when parsing the documents into structured machine-readable format for downstream applications. Deep neural networks that are developed for computer vision have been proven to be an effective method to analyze layout of document images. However, document layout datasets that are currently publicly available are several magnitudes smaller than established computing vision datasets. Models have to be trained by transfer learning from a base model that is pre-trained on a traditional computer vision dataset. In this paper, we develop the PubLayNet dataset for document layout analysis by automatically matching the XML representations and the content of over 1 million PDF articles that are publicly available on PubMed Central™. The size of the dataset is comparable to established computer vision datasets, containing over 360 thousand document images, where typical document layout elements are annotated. The experiments demonstrate that deep neural networks trained on PubLayNet accurately recognize the layout of scientiﬁc articles. The pre-trained models are also a more effective base mode for transfer learning on a different document domain. We release the dataset (https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet) to support development and evaluation of more advanced models for document layout analysis.

      "I. INTRODUCTION Documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) are ubiquitous with around 2.5 trillion documents available in this format [1]. While these documents are convenient for human consumption, automatic processing of these documents is difﬁcult since understanding the document layout and extracting information using this format is complicated. Geometric layout analysis techniques based on an image representation of the document combined with optical character recognition (OCR) methods [2]–[4] were ﬁrstly used to understand these documents. More recently, image analytics methods based on deep learning are becoming available [5] and are used to train document layout understanding pipelines [1], [6]. Machine learning methods require training data to become successful. In addition, there is a large variety of document templates, which makes this task even more challenging since this increases the number of documents that need to be manually annotated.

      "a slow and expensive process, which is a stepping curve when willing to use these techniques in new domains. In this work, we propose a method to automatically annotate the document layout of over 1 million PubMed Central™ PDF articles and generate a high-quality document layout dataset called PubLayNet. The dataset contains over 360k page samples and covers typical document layout elements such as text, title, list, ﬁgure, and table. Then, we evaluate deep object detection neural networks on the PubLayNet dataset and the performance of ﬁne tuning the networks on existing small manually annotated corpora. We show that the automatically annotated dataset is suitable to train a model to recognize the layout of scientiﬁc articles, and the model pre-trained on the dataset can be a more effective base in transfer learning. \n",

      "II. RELATED WORK Existing datasets for document layout analysis rely on manual annotation. Some of these datasets are used in document processing challenges. Examples of these efforts are available in several ICDAR challenges [7], which cover as well complex layouts [8], [9]. The US NIH National Library of Medicine has provided the Medical Article Records Groundtruth (MARG)1, which are obtained from scanned article pages. In addition to document layout, further understanding of the document content has been studied in the evaluation of table detection methods, e.g. [10], [11]. Examples include table detection from document images using heuristics [12], vertical arrangement of text blocks [13] and deep learning methods [14]–[17]. Overall, the datasets are of limited size, just several hundred pages, which is mostly due to the need for manual annotation. In the next section, we describe how multiple versions of the same document from PubMed Central™ are used to automatically generate document layout annotations for over 1 million documents. III.

The XML version of the PMCOA documents is a structured representation of its content and all XML documents follow the schema provided by the NLM for journals2. Since the content in the PDF version of the articles and their XML representation contain similar format, we have identiﬁed a method to use these two representations of the same article to identify document layout components. In this work, a total of 1,162,856 articles that have a complete XML representation were downloaded from ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/pmc on 3 October 2018, and automatically annotated with the method described in the following sections. A. Layout categories The structured XML representation of the articles in the PMCOA dataset contains many different categories of nodes, which are difﬁcult, even for humans, to distinguish based only on document images. We aggregated the categories of the nodes in the XML into the document layout categories shown in Table I, based on the following considerations: • The differences between the categories are distinctive and intuitive for a visual model to capture learnable patterns. • The categories are commonly found in documents in various domains. • The categories cover most elements that are important for downstream studies, such as text classiﬁcation, entity recognition, ﬁgure/table understanding, etc. \n",

      "and segmentation of the PDF elements are calculated. The XML nodes are used to decide the category label for each bounding box and segmentation. Finally, a quality control metric is deﬁned to control the noise of the annotations at an extremely low level. 1) PMCOA XML pre-processing and parsing: Some of the nodes in the XML tree are not considered for matching, such as tex-math, edition, institution-id, and disp-formula. These nodes are removed, as the content of these nodes may interfere with the matching of other nodes. The placement of list, table and ﬁgure nodes in the XML schema is not consistent across the articles. We standardized the XML tree by moving list, table, and ﬁgure nodes into the ﬂoats-group branch. Then, the nodes in the XML tree are split into ﬁve groups: • Sorted: including paper title, abstract, keywords, section  \n",
      "\n",
      "titles, and text in main text. The order of sorted XML nodes matches the reading order in the PDF document. • Unsorted: including copyright statement, license, authors, afﬁliations, acknowledgments, and abbreviations. The order of unsorted XML nodes may not match the reading order in the PDF document. • Figures: including caption label (e.g., ‘Fig. 1’), caption text, and ﬁgure body • Tables: including caption label (e.g. Table I), caption text, footnotes, and table body • Lists: including lists. 2) PMCOA PDF parsing: Fig. 1c illustrates an example of the layout of a PDF page parsed using the PDFMiner3 package, where three layout types are extracted: • textbox (red): block of text, consisting of textlines (blue). Each textbox has three attributes: the text in the textbox, the bounding box of the textbox, and textlines in the textbox. Each textline has two attributes: the text in the textline and the bounding box of the textline. • image (green): consisting of images. Each image is associated with a bounding box. • geometric shape (yellow): consisting of lines, curves, and rectangles. Each geometric shape is associated with a bounding box. 3) String pre-processing: The strings from XML and PDF are Unicode strings. The Unicode standard deﬁnes various normalization forms of a Unicode string, based on the deﬁnition of canonical equivalence and compatibility equivalence. In Unicode, several characters can be expressed in various ways. To make the matching between XML and PDF more robust, the strings are normalized to the KD normal form4 (i.e., replacing all compatibility characters with their equivalents). 4) PDF-XML matching algorithms: There are frequent minor discrepancies between the content of PDF parsed by PDFMiner and the text of XML nodes. Thus fuzzy string matching is adopted to tolerate minor discrepancies. We use the fuzzysearch5 package to search for the closest match to a target string in a source string, where string distance is measured by the Levenshtein distance [18]. The maximum distance allowed for a match (dmax) is adaptive to the length of the target string (ltarget) as, if ltarget ≤ 20 dmax = 0.15 ∗ ltarget if 20 < ltarget ≤ 40  0.2 ∗ ltarget 0.1 ∗ ltarget if ltarget > 40 As one textbox may cover multiple XML nodes, we sequentially search the textlines of a textbox in the text of a XML node. If the textline of the textbox cannot be found in the text of the XML node, we skip to and search the next textbox. If the end of the XML node is reached, but the textline is not the end of the textbox, the textbox is divided into two textboxes \n",
      "\n",
      "3https://github.com/euske/pdfminer 4http://unicode.org/reports/tr15/ 5https://github.com/taleinat/fuzzysearch  \n",
      "\n",
      "at the current textline. Then the former textbox is appended to the list of matched textboxes of the XML node. When all the content of the XML node is covered by matching textlines, we start searching in the next XML node. This matching procedure is applied to all the text XML nodes, including the ‘Sorted’, ‘Unsorted’, and ‘Lists’ groups; the captions in the ‘Tables’ and ‘Figures’ groups; and the footnotes in the ‘Table’ group. Depending on the template of speciﬁc journals, section/subsection titles may be inline with the ﬁrst paragraph in the section. A title is treated as inline titles if the last line of the title does not cover a whole textline. Inline section titles are annotated as part of the text, rather than individual instances of titles. The same principle is also applied to the caption labels of ﬁgures and tables. After all the text XML nodes are processed, the margin between annotated text elements in the PDF page is utilized to annotate the body of ﬁgures and tables. Fig. 2 illustrates an example of the annotation process for a ﬁgure body. First, the bounding box of the main text of the article (green box) is obtained as the smallest bounding box that encloses all the annotated text elements in the article. Then the potential box (blue box) for the ﬁgure is calculated as the the largest box that can be ﬁt in the margin between the top of the caption box (brown box) and the annotated text elements above the caption. The last step is to annotate the ﬁgure body with the smallest box (red box) that encloses all the textboxes, images, and geometric shapes within the potential box. Table bodies are annotated using the same principle, where it is assumed that table bodies are always below the caption of the tables. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 2: Annotation process for an example ﬁgure. The main text box and the potential box are determined from the annotations of the caption of the ﬁgure and surrounding text elements. The ﬁnal annotation is made as the smallest box that encloses all the textboxes, images, and geometric shapes within the potential box.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5) Generation of instance segmentation: For text, title, and list instances, we automatically generate segmentations from the texelines of the PDF elements, which allows us to train the Mask-RCNN model [5]. As shown in Fig. 3, the top edge of the top textline and the bottom edge of the bottom textline in the PDF elements forms the top and bottom edge of the segmentation, respectively. The right edge of the textlines are scanned from top to bottom to form the right side of the segmentation. -shape edges are inserted if the right edge of a textline is on the left of the right edge of the textline above it. Otherwise, -shape edges are inserted. The left side of the segmentation is generated by scanning the left edge of the textlines from bottom to top using the same principle. For ﬁgure and table instances, the bounding box is reused as the segmentation, since almost all these instances are rectangular. Fig. 1d illustrates the annotations for the PDF page in Fig. 1a. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 3: Example of generating layout segmentation based on textlines. The segmentation is a regular polygon, consisting of only horizontal and vertical edges. The shape of the segmentation is decided by the position of adjacent textlines. \n",
      "\n",
      "6) Quality control: There are several sources that can lead to discrepancies between the PDF parsing results and the corresponding XML. When discrepancies are over the threshold dmax, the annotation algorithm may not be able to identify all elements in a document page. For example, PDFminer parses some complex inline formulas completely differently from the XML, which leads to a large Levenshtein distance and failure to match PDF elements with XML nodes. Hence we need a way to evaluate how well a PDF page is annotated and eliminate poorly annotated pages from PubLayNet. The annotation quality of a PDF page is deﬁned as the ratio of the area of textboxes, images, and geometric shapes that are annotated to the area of textboxes, images, and geometric shapes within the main text box of the page. Non-title pages of which the annotation quality is less than 99% are excluded from PubLayNet, which is an extremely high standard to control the noise in PubLayNet at a low level. The format of title pages of different journals varies substantially. Miscellaneous information, such as manuscript history (dates of submission, revision, acceptance), copyright statement, editorial details, etc, is often included in title pages, but formatted differently from the XML representation and therefore missed in the annotations. To include adequate title pages, we set the threshold of annotation quality to 90% for  \n",
      "\n",
      "title pages. C. Data partition The annotated PDF pages are partitioned into training, development, and testing sets at journal level to maximize the differences between the sets. This allows better evaluation of how well a model generalizes to unseen paper templates. The journals that contain ≤ 2000 pages, ≥ 320 ﬁgures, ≥ 140 tables, and ≥ 20 lists are extracted to generate the development and testing sets. This avoids the development and testing sets from being dominated by a particular journal with a large number of pages, and ensures the development and testing sets have an adequate number instances of ﬁgures, tables, and lists. Half of these journals are randomly drawn to generate the development set. The development set consists of all pages with a list in these journals, as well as 2000 title pages, 3000 pages with a table, 3000 pages with a ﬁgure, and 2000 plain pages, which are randomly drawn from these journals. The testing set is generated using the same procedure on the rest half of the journals. To further reduce the noise in the development and testing sets and make more valid evaluation of models, the development and testing sets are curated by human, where profound erroneous pages are removed and moderate erroneous pages are corrected. The journals that do not satisfy the criteria above are used to generate the training set. To ensure diversity of the training data, from each of the journals, we randomly drawn at most 200 pages with a list, 50 pages with a table, 50 pages with a ﬁgure, 50 title pages, and 25 plain pages. The statistics of the training, development, and testing sets are depicted in detail in Table II. \n",

A. Document layout recognition using deep learning We trained a F-RCNN model and a M-RCNN model on PubLayNet using the Detectron implementation [20]. PDF pages are converted to images using the pdf2image package7. Each model was trained for 180k iterations with a base learning rate of 0.01. The learning rate was reduced by a factor of 10 at the 120k iteration and the 160k iteration. The models were trained on 8 GPUs with one image per GPU, which yields an effective mini-batch size of 8. Both models use the ResNeXt-101-64x4d model as the backbone, which was initialized with the model pre-trained on ImageNet. The performance of the F-RCNN and the M-RCNN models on our development and testing sets are depicted in Table III. The evaluation metric is the mean average precision (MAP) @ intersection over union (IOU) [0.50:0.95] of bounding boxes, which is used in the COCO competition8. Both models can generate accurate (MAP > 0.9) document layout, where M-RCNN shows a small advantage over F-RCNN. The models are more accurate at detecting tables and ﬁgures than texts, titles, and lists. We think this is attributed to more regular shapes, more distinctive differences from other categories, and lower rate of erroneous annotations in the training set. The models perform worst on titles, as titles are usually much smaller than other categories and more difﬁcult to detect. \n",

      "B. Table detection The ICDAR 2013 Table Competition [21] is one of the most prestigious competitions on table detection in PDF documents from European government sources. We created a table detection dataset by extracting from our training set the PDF pages that contain one or more tables, and remove non-table instances from the annotations. We trained a F-RCNN model and a M-RCNN model on this table detection dataset under the same conﬁguration described in Section IV-A. Then the models are ﬁne-tuned with the 170 example PDF pages provided by the competition. For ﬁne-tuning, we used a base learning rate 0.001, which was decreased by 10 at the 100th iteration out of 200 total iterations. The minimum conﬁdence score for a detection is decided by a 5-fold cross-validation on the 170 training pages. The ﬁne-tuned model was evaluated on the formal competition dataset (238 pages) using the ofﬁcial evaluation toolkit 9. Table IV compares the performance of the ﬁne-tuned models and published approaches. The ﬁne tuned F-RCNN model achieves the state-of-the-art performance reported in [6], where the F-RCNN model was ﬁne tuned with 1600 samples from a pre-trained object detection model. By ﬁne tuning from a model pre-trained on document samples, we can obtain the same level of performance with much smaller training data (170 samples). \n",

Employees are provided with Summary Plan 0.907 Description (SPD) documents typically in PDF, which describe the beneﬁts provided by the private health insurers. There is a large variety in the layout of SPD documents provided by different companies. The layout of these documents is also distinctively different from scientiﬁc publications. We manually annotated the texts, tables, and lists in 20 representative SPD documents that cover a large number of possible layouts. This domain speciﬁc dataset contains 2,131 pages, 9,379, 2,500, and 820 instances of text, tables, and layout lists, respectively.

We also tested the zero-shot performance of the pre-trained PubLayNet model. The comparison of the performance of the approaches is illustrated in Table V. The performance of the zero-shot PubLayNet model is considerably worse than the ﬁne-tuned models, which demonstrates the distinct difference between the layout of SPD documents and PubMed Central™ articles. Fine tuning the pre-trained PubLayNet model can substantially outperform other ﬁne-tuned models. This demonstrates the advantage of using PubLayNet for document layout analysis. The only exception is that ﬁne tuning pre-trained COCO F-RCNN model detects tables more accurately than ﬁne tuning pre-trained PubLayNet F-RCNN model. In addition, the improvement on table detection by ﬁne tuning pre-trained PubLayNet MRCNN model is relatively low to that on text and list detection.

      "V. DISCUSSION PMCOA provides a large set of documents available at the same time in PDF and XML format. The methodology proposed in this work to generate a large dataset of article pages automatically annotated with the location of document layout components using the PMCOA documents. The quality assurance has shown that the automatically generated annotations are of high quality. In addition, existing state-of-the-art object detection algorithms reproduce successfully the annotations from the automatically annotated set. The title category seems to be the weakest one. The identiﬁcation of titles is challenging due to the different ways in which titles are present in the documents. On the other hand, titles are identiﬁed as text in ICDAR competitions and titles could be merged with the text category in this set up. The documents in PubLayNet are all scientiﬁc literature, which is domain speciﬁc and limits the heterogeneity of layout. We took several methods in developing and partition PubLayNet to utilize as much variation in PMCOA as possible and prevent PubLayNet from being dominated by a certain journal. With over 6,500 journals included in PMCOA, our experiment shows that the training set is heterogeneous enough  \n",

      "VI. CONCLUSION We automatically generated the PubLayNet dataset, which is the largest ever available document layout annotation dataset exploiting redundancy in PCMOA. This dataset allows state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to be trained delivering high performance layout recognition on biomedical articles. Furthermore, this dataset is shown to be helpful to pre-train object detection algorithms to identify tables and different document layout objects in health insurance documents. These results are encouraging since the developed dataset is potentially helpful for document layout annotation of other domains. PubLayNet is available from https://github. com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubLayNet. As future work, we plan to exploit PMCOA for automatic generation of large datasets to solve other document analysis problems with deep learning models. For example, PubLayNet does not contain relationships between the layout elements, e.g., a paragraph and a section title. Such information is available in the XML representation and can be exploit to automatically create a dataset of the logical structure of documents. \n",
